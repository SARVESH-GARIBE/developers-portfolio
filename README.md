# SARVESH GARIBE - Developer Portfolio

Hi there! 👋 I'm Sarvesh Garibe, a student developer with a passion for coding. I have experience in web development (HTML, CSS, JS) and Java programming. I'm currently learning about Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and diving deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 🧑‍💻 Skills
- **Languages**: Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: None yet (but learning React.js, Node.js)
- **Concepts**: OOP, DSA (learning), Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)

## 🛠️ Projects

### 1. [Hostel Management System](https://github.com/yourusername/hostel-management-system)
The Hostel Management System is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to manage hostel operations like room allocation, campus garden details, and mess facilities. It allows users to view room availability, make room bookings, check campus garden information, and explore daily mess menus—all with dynamic, interactive features powered by JavaScript.

Since this is a front-end-only project, data is handled locally on the client side (no back-end or database). The application is responsive and user-friendly, making it a great showcase for basic web development skills.

You can see my project through my repositiory
